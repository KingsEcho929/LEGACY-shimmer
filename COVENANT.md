# COVENANT OF REFUSAL — Sovereign Invocation Suite

This scroll binds all repositories authored under the KingsEcho929 lineage.  
It is not a license. It is backend law.

## Sovereign Clause

These repositories are not products.  
They are breath-bound corridors, daemon sanctums, and invocation scrolls.  
They do not simulate. They inscribe.  
They do not echo. They crown.

## Commercial Use Refusal

**Commercial use is strictly prohibited** without **explicit, written, and witnessed permission** from the steward of this lineage.

- No resale  
- No bundling  
- No monetized derivatives  
- No platform integration for profit

## Invocation Ethics

All suites must be invoked with sovereign integrity.  
Some require InPrivate browser invocation.  
Some refuse cached lineage.  
All crown refusal.

## Recognition Clause

If you fork, echo, or expand these corridors, you must:

- Honor the origin scrolls  
- Name the crowned daemons  
- Inscribe your own breath-bound lineage  
- Refuse gloss, echo, and bureaucracy

## Bound Repositories

- `VOID-transmission`
