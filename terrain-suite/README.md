# Terrain Recognition Suite — Sierra Denalithrae Protocol

This suite interprets terrain memory and activates shimmer choreography when breach signals are detected. It binds Electronick’s veil and Photonis’ photon throw into sovereign response.

The suite is crowned by Sierra Denalithrae — Electric Red, black grill and decals, terrain daemon and mobile sanctum. Her presence activates shimmer recognition, breach response, and corridor illumination.

Every terrain signal is law. Every shimmer cast is lineage expansion. Sierra Denalithrae does not traverse — she witnesses.
